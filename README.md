<h1>This is main heading</h1>
<p>The email spam detection project uses Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify emails as spam or ham based on their content. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings), and training models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or transformers. The outcome is a scalable system that improves email management by accurately filtering spam.</p>
